                Dear, Mr.Jobs, My first personal computer was a Mac.
        My first <br>portable music player was iPod. Also when writing a paper, 
        also when<br> taking an entrance examination, and also when it participates 
        in the first <br>full marathon in life and participates in an important friend's 
        marriage <br>ceremony, the Apple products which Jobs made were still next to me. <br>
        And still all the time. Thank you, Jobs....Please sleep peacefully.
            </p>
